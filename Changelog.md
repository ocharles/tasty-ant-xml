# 1.1.9

## Other changes

* Support `tasty-1.5`. Thanks to @sergv (PR #34).

# 1.1.8

## Other Changes

* Support `tasty-1.4`. Due to major API changes, 1.4 is now the minimum version
  of `tasty` supported. Thanks to @jkachmar (PR #31).

# 1.1.7

## Other Changes

* Bump upper bound of `tasty`.

# 1.1.6

## Functionality Changes

* The order of tests is now reversed from what was previously output (which was
  itself reversed). This means that tests are now reported in the order they are
  defined, as expected. Thanks to @feuerbach for this fix. See
  https://github.com/ocharles/tasty-ant-xml/pull/28 for more information.

# 1.1.0

## Breaking Changes

* The XML generated is now slightly different in order to satisfy Jenkins. In
  particular:

  * The `classname` attribute now joins the test path with `.` (like a Java
    class name).
  * `testsuite` nodes have a `tests` attribute, which is the amount of tests
    executed.
